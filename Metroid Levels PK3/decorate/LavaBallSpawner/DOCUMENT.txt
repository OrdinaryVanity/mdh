Place on map and use the five arguments to control the intensity and area of the 
spawner.

First argument controls the size of the area. 32, for example, spawns in a 64x64
square (or 64 diameter circle. See second argument).

Second argument controls the type of area it spawns in. 0 is square, 1 is
circle.

Third argument controls it's frequency. The lower the number, the heavier the
amount of lava balls.

If the fourth argument is non-zero, the ball will not do damage, and will be
client-sided.

The fifth argument controls the velocity of the projectile.

It only spawns things when not submerged in deep water. However, if placed in
deep water, it will automatically surface before it starts spawning.
