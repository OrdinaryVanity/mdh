This spawner uses all five arguments. The first controls the x and y dimensions
of the spawner (times two). The second controls the z dimension (the bottom is
the z-level the spawner is on). The third is the minimum speed the ash particles
can have, and the fourth is the maximum, randomized between the two. The fifth
controls the freqency of the spawner; 0 is always, 255 is never.

64,128,3,6,128 will spawn ash at 50% frequency in a 128x128x128 cube, at 3-6 map
units per-tic.

It will launch the ash particles in the direction the spawner is facing. You can
also deactivate and reactivate it through ACS.
