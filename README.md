<h1>Metroid - Demon Hunter</h1>
A GZDoom compatible mod

<h2>What is this repo?</h2>
This repo consists of two folders:

1. Main.pk3: The majority of game code. Everything from Samus' abilities and weapons to item drops and how drops are handled.
2. Metroid Levels.pk3: Contains maps and map editing resources (textures, models, props).
3. Scans.pk3 Contains all the scan visor entries.

<h2>What is this mod?</h2>

This mod is a fork of the original Metroid Dreadnought by TerminusEST13. I started working on this mod adding small things here and there and tinkering with code a little bit. Over the years it has grown significantly, and I fixed bugs that prevented the mod from running with GZDoom. I have added more abilities, balanced the weaponry, and with the help of others we have added new sprites and models and a new HUD!

<h2>Why 'Demon Hunter'?</h2>
Dreadnought isn't really appropriate to use anymore now that Dread is a real thing. Also, Demon Hunter is a campaign! Finally, a campaign for this mod!

<h2>What else is different?</h2>
For starters, I'm porting classes over to ZScript. This allowed for a real Gravity Suit and a Scan Visor. Monster mod compatibility will be possible as well!
